Problem Description:
---------------------
In this problem, you are tasked with finding an order in which you can take a set number of courses such that for every course you are taking, you have already completed all its prerequisites. You are given two inputs:

numCourses which is an integer representing the total number of courses you need to take, numbered from 0 to numCourses - 1.
prerequisites which is a list of pairs [a_i, b_i], where a_i is a course that you want to take and b_i is the course that must be taken before a_i.
Your objective is to return a list representing the order in which you can take the courses. If there are multiple correct orders, any one of them is a valid answer. If it's impossible to complete all the courses (for example, because of a cycle in the prerequisite structure), you should return an empty list.

This problem can be thought of as a graph problem where each course is a node in the graph, and the prerequisites are directed edges between nodes. The task is to find a topological sort of this graph, which is an ordering of its nodes such that for every directed edge u â†’ v, node u comes before node v in the ordering.


Intuition:
---------------
The solution to this problem involves using a graph data structure to represent the prerequisite courses relationship and then performing a topological sort on this graph. The key steps to solve this problem are as follows:

1) Create a graph representation:
Each course is represented as a node.
A directed edge from node b_i to node a_i is added for each prerequisite pair [a_i, b_i]. This indicates that course b_i is a prerequisite for course a_i.

2) Determine the in-degree for each node:
The in-degree of a node is the number of edges coming into it. In this scenario, it represents the number of prerequisites for a course.

3) Initiate a queue and add all nodes with an in-degree of 0 to it:
These are the courses that don't have any prerequisites, which can be taken first.

4) While the queue is not empty, process the nodes:
Dequeue a node (a course with no prerequisites) and add it to the solution list, indicating the course can be taken.
For each neighbor (course that has the just-taken course as prerequisite), decrement its in-degree (since one of its prerequisites has been taken).
If a neighbor's in-degree becomes 0, enqueue it. This signifies that all its prerequisites are met, and it can be taken.

5) Check if the number of courses taken matches the total number of courses.
If they match, return the solution list as a valid order.
If they do not match, a cycle must exist in the graph, and thus it is impossible to complete all courses. Return an empty list.

Using this strategy, the given implementation builds the graph using a hashmap (g) for adjacency lists and an array (indeg) for in-degree counts. It then uses a queue (q) to identify courses with no prerequisites and processes them to uncover an acceptable course order (ans), which is returned as the solution.
