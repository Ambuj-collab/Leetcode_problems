Intuition:
------------
The intuition behind the 3 solutions is to iteratively find the longest substring without repeating characters by maintaining a sliding window approach. We use two pointers (left and right) to represent the boundaries of the current substring. As we iterate through the string, we update the pointers and adjust the window to accommodate new unique characters and eliminate repeating characters.
