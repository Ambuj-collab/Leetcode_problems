When I think about a solution, I usually start with the small and simple input, because it's easy to understand and find a solution. But this time let's start with a big input.
Input: "xkarqzghhgfedcbabcdefgzdekx"

â–  Question
1) How did you find longest palindromic substring?

I believe you choose one character, then expand the range to left and right at the same time. If you find longest palindromic substring directly, you are not a human. lol

Actually, that is main idea of my solution today. But problem is that we don't know where to start. That's why we need to shift start point one by one.

We need to shift a start point one by one to check longest palindromic substring.

2) What is the start point?
Since palindromic substring is like a mirror from some character, it's good idea to consider current index as a center of palindromic substring and expand left and right at the same time.

For example,

Input = "abcba"
If we start from c, then

"ab" "c" "ba"
      i

i = curerent index
"ab" and "ba" is a mirror when "c" is center.
